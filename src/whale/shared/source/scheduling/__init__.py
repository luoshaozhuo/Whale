"""Public exports for the worker-local source polling kernel.

This package contains protocol-agnostic scheduling primitives used by
SourceRuntime/worker layers to run high-frequency source polling inside one
worker process and one asyncio event loop. It is not a general-purpose
scheduler and it is not a replacement for APScheduler.

Typical layering:
- APScheduler or another low-frequency orchestrator manages runtime lifecycle;
- runtime/supervisor layers shard sources across workers or processes;
- each worker uses this package for local staggering, concurrency limiting,
  and fixed-rate polling execution.
